Install Docker compose
Run this command to download the latest version of Docker Compose:

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Apply executable permissions to the binary:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
After you do the curl command , it'll put docker-compose into the

/usr/local/bin
which is not on the PATH To fix it, create a symbolic link:

sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
And now if you do: docker-compose --version
